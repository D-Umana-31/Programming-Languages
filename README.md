# Cplusplus-Program

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  In this project we were task to create a banking app where a user could enter their intitial investment, a monthly deposit, the annual interest, and number of years. Then based on user input, the app would display end of year balance for each year with interest earned without monthly deposits and display the same info with the monthly deposits. The user should be able to play around with the amounts they entered. 
  
What did you do particularly well?
  I think that this code is well orginized and readable. I think I did a good job of trying to implement object oriented programming. I like the display for the user when running the program.
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  One imporvement that would be beneficial for this project is input validation. I think that ensuring the user is inputing positive, real numbers will help the program execute more effeciently. 
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  One section of the code I found challenging was the code to calculate the balances and interest. When first developing my code, I was inputing the code to calculate based on the math equation, but all of my balances were coming shortly off. It took a lot of trial and error to figure out how to compute the balances and interest correctly. 
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  I think that the skills I learned for object oriented programming will be great when working on future projects. I think that the skills I've learned to develop well organized and readable code will benefit me going forward. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  The orginization of the project helps to make this code readable. I tried to follow industry standards when writing the comments to explain the functions happening within the code. I think that my spacing also helps to make the code more readable and maintainable.
